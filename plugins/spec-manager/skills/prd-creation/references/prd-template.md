## Section Guidelines

### Overview
- Keep it concise (2-3 paragraphs max)
- Lead with the "what" and "why"
- Make it understandable to non-technical stakeholders
- Include key differentiators or unique aspects

### Problem Statement
- Be specific about the problem
- Include evidence or data if available
- Avoid solution language in this section
- Make the pain point visceral and relatable

### Goals & Success Metrics
- Make metrics measurable and time-bound
- Include both leading and lagging indicators
- Define the measurement methodology
- Set realistic but ambitious targets

### Functional Requirements
- Use clear, testable language
- Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Prioritize ruthlessly (P0/P1/P2)
- Reference user stories where applicable
- Number requirements for easy reference (FR-001, FR-002)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Be specific with numbers (latency < 200ms, not "fast")
- Consider all quality attributes relevant to the project
- Balance ideals with practical constraints
- Only include sections that apply

### User Stories
- Follow the standard format consistently
- Include acceptance criteria for each story
- Group by persona or journey
- Keep stories independent and testable

### Out of Scope / Non-Goals
- Be explicit about exclusions
- Explain reasoning briefly
- Reference where deferred items might live
- Prevent scope creep proactively

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Name | Definition |
|----------|------|------------|
| P0 | Must Have | Critical for launch. Without this, the project fails or is unusable. |
