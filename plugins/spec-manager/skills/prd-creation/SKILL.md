# PRD Creation Skill

This skill provides the methodology and interview framework for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) through guided conversations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use PRD creation when:

- **Starting a new project** - Establish clear requirements before coding
- **Defining features** - Document what needs to be built and why
- **Aligning stakeholders** - Create shared understanding of goals
- **Preparing for AI-assisted development** - Generate specs optimized for AI coding agents
- **Capturing existing requirements** - Analyze and structure provided requirements

## PRD Document Purpose

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) focuses on:
- **What** needs to be built
- **Why** it matters
- **Who** it's for
- **How success is measured**

PRDs are written for stakeholders, developers, and AI coding agents. They provide the foundation for technical implementation decisions.

## Interview-Driven Approach

PRD creation uses a conversational interview to gather requirements. This approach:

1. **Adapts to context** - Questions vary based on project type and provided input
2. **Builds understanding** - Natural conversation reveals nuances
3. **Validates assumptions** - Clarifying questions catch misunderstandings
4. **Handles pre-existing requirements** - Can analyze and enhance provided documentation

### Input Methods

The interview supports three input modes:

| Mode | Description | Interview Behavior |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| File reference | `@overview.md` | Analyzes file, pre-populates data, asks targeted follow-ups |
| Inline text | `"Build a..."` | Analyzes text, pre-populates data, asks targeted follow-ups |
| No input | Fresh start | Full interview from scratch |

### Interview Phases

1. **Analysis** (if input provided) - Extract data from overview, identify gaps
2. **Foundation** - Project name, type, summary, context
3. **Objectives** - Problem statement, goals, success metrics, non-goals
4. **User Stories** - Personas, needs, stories, edge cases
5. **Functional** - P0/P1/P2 features, integrations, constraints
6. **NFR** - Non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, risks
7. **Generation** - Review summary, generate document

## Document Output

PRDs are generated at `specs/<project-name>.prd.md` with:

- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata (project name, version, timestamps)
- **Markdown content** following consistent template
- **Prioritized requirements** (P0/P1/P2)
- **Acceptance criteria** for testability

### Output Structure

```
specs/
└── my-project.prd.md
```

## Overview Analysis Feature

When an overview is provided upfront, the interviewer:

1. **Reads thoroughly** - Parses entire input
2. **Extracts systematically** - Maps content to PRD sections
3. **Identifies gaps** - Notes missing required information
4. **Flags ambiguities** - Highlights unclear or conflicting items
5. **Presents findings** - Shows user what was extracted
6. **Asks targeted questions** - Focuses on gaps, not redundant info

This dramatically reduces interview time when users have an existing overview file.

## Best Practices

### For Effective Interviews

1. **Start broad, get specific** - Let context emerge naturally
2. **Validate understanding** - Summarize and confirm key points
3. **Probe red flags** - Vague goals, unclear scope, conflicting requirements
4. **Respect scope** - Note but defer tangential topics
5. **Adapt to user** - Some need more guidance, others less

### For Quality Documents

1. **Be specific** - Vague requirements lead to vague implementations
2. **Include acceptance criteria** - Make requirements testable
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - P0 means "can't launch without"
4. **Document non-goals** - Prevent scope creep
5. **Consider AI agents** - Write for machine readability

### For AI-Optimized Specs

PRDs generated by this skill are optimized for AI coding agents:

- **Clear structure** - Consistent formatting aids parsing
- **Explicit requirements** - No ambiguity in what needs to be built
- **Testable criteria** - AI can verify implementation correctness
- **Context provided** - Background information explains decisions
- **Modular breakdown** - Requirements can be implemented independently

## State Management

Interview state is saved to `.claude/spec-manager.state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "current_project": "project-name",
  "interview_phase": "objectives",
  "project_overview": {
    "provided": true,
    "source": "file",
    "analysis": { ... }
  },
  "collected_data": { ... },
  "phases_completed": ["analysis", "foundation"],
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

This enables:
- **Session resume** - Continue interrupted interviews
- **Progress tracking** - Know what's been covered
- **Data preservation** - Don't lose gathered information
