# SDD Process Skill

This skill provides the methodology, interview framework, and document templates for Spec Driven Development (SDD).

## When to Use This Skill

Use the SDD methodology when:

- **Starting a new project** - Establish clear requirements before coding
- **Defining features** - Document what needs to be built and why
- **Aligning stakeholders** - Create shared understanding of goals
- **Preparing for AI-assisted development** - Generate specs optimized for AI coding agents
- **Documenting technical decisions** - Capture architecture and design choices

## SDD Document Types

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Focuses on **what** and **why**
- Defines problem, goals, requirements, and success metrics
- Written for stakeholders and developers
- Primary artifact for most projects

### Technical Specification (Tech Spec)
- Focuses on **how** at a system level
- Defines architecture, data models, APIs, technology choices
- Written for developers and AI coding agents
- Generated when technical complexity warrants it

### Design Specification (Design Spec)
- Focuses on **how** at a user experience level
- Defines user flows, components, interactions, accessibility
- Written for designers and frontend developers
- Generated when project has UI/UX components

## Interview-Driven Approach

SDD uses a conversational interview to gather requirements. This approach:

1. **Adapts to context** - Questions vary based on project type and complexity
2. **Builds understanding** - Natural conversation reveals nuances
3. **Validates assumptions** - Clarifying questions catch misunderstandings
4. **Respects time** - Detail level is configurable

### Interview Phases

1. **Foundation** - Project name, type, relationship to existing systems
2. **Problem** - What's being solved and for whom
3. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional needs
4. **Technical** - Architecture and implementation considerations
5. **Design** - User experience and interface needs (if applicable)
6. **Generation** - Document creation based on collected information

### Detail Levels

| Level | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| High-level | Overview and key decisions | Early exploration, quick alignment |
| Mid-level | Detailed requirements with guidance | Most projects |
| In-depth | Comprehensive, implementation-ready | Complex projects, AI agents |

## Document Output

Documents are generated in `specs/<project-name>/` with:

- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata (project name, version, timestamps, related docs)
- **Markdown content** following consistent templates
- **Cross-references** between related documents

### Output Structure

```
specs/
└── my-project/
    ├── prd.md
    ├── tech-spec.md      # if technical complexity warrants
    └── design-spec.md    # if UI/UX components exist
```

## Interview Framework

See `references/interview-framework.md` for:
- Complete question categories
- Question sequencing guidelines
- Natural conversation principles
- Completion checklist

## Document Templates

See reference files for detailed templates:
- `references/prd-template.md` - PRD structure and guidelines
- `references/tech-spec-template.md` - Tech Spec structure and guidelines
- `references/design-spec-template.md` - Design Spec structure and guidelines

## Best Practices

### For Effective Interviews

1. **Start broad, get specific** - Let context emerge naturally
2. **Validate understanding** - Summarize and confirm key points
3. **Probe red flags** - Vague goals, unclear scope, conflicting requirements
4. **Respect scope** - Note but defer tangential topics
5. **Adapt to user** - Some need more guidance, others less

### For Quality Documents

1. **Be specific** - Vague requirements lead to vague implementations
2. **Include acceptance criteria** - Make requirements testable
3. **Document decisions** - Explain why, not just what
4. **Consider AI agents** - Write for machine readability
5. **Link related items** - Cross-reference between documents

### For AI-Optimized Specs

Documents generated by SDD are optimized for AI coding agents:

- **Clear structure** - Consistent formatting aids parsing
- **Explicit requirements** - No ambiguity in what needs to be built
- **Testable criteria** - AI can verify implementation correctness
- **Context provided** - Background information explains decisions
- **Modular breakdown** - Requirements can be implemented independently

## State Management

Interview state is saved to `.claude/sdd-manager.state.json`:

```json
{
  "current_project": "project-name",
  "interview_phase": "requirements",
  "collected_data": {
    "project_name": "...",
    "project_type": "...",
    "problem_statement": "...",
    ...
  },
  "documents_to_generate": ["prd", "tech-spec"],
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

This enables:
- **Session resume** - Continue interrupted interviews
- **Progress tracking** - Know what's been covered
- **Data preservation** - Don't lose gathered information
