- Make the pain point visceral and relatable

### Goals & Success Metrics
- Make metrics measurable and time-bound
- Include both leading and lagging indicators
- Define the measurement methodology
- Set realistic but ambitious targets

### Functional Requirements
- Use clear, testable language
- Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Prioritize ruthlessly (P0/P1/P2)
- Reference user stories where applicable

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Be specific with numbers (latency < 200ms, not "fast")
- Consider all quality attributes
- Include compliance requirements early
- Balance ideals with practical constraints

### User Stories
