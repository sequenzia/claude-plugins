# Git Workflow

This skill routes git operations to the appropriate commands based on user intent.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user wants to:

- **Commit only**: "commit changes", "save changes", "commit this", "commit it", "commit my work"
- **Push only**: "push changes", "push to remote", "push it up", "push this", "push it"
- **Both**: "commit and push", "ship it", "send it up", "save and push"

## Behavior

### Commit Only

When the user's intent is to commit without pushing:

**Trigger phrases**: commit, save changes, commit this, commit it, commit my work

**Action**: Run `/dev-tools:git-commit`

### Push Only

When the user's intent is to push existing commits without creating a new commit:

**Trigger phrases**: push, push changes, push to remote, push it up, push it

**Action**: Run `/dev-tools:git-push`

### Commit and Push

When the user wants to commit their changes AND push them to the remote:

**Trigger phrases**: commit and push, ship it, send it up, save and push

**Action**: Run `/dev-tools:git-commit` first, then `/dev-tools:git-push`

## Decision Logic

1. Parse the user's request for intent keywords
2. If request contains "push" but NOT "commit" → push only
3. If request contains "commit" or "save" but NOT "push" → commit only
4. If request contains both "commit" and "push" → commit then push
5. If request matches "ship it" or "send it up" → commit then push

## Notes

- The commit command stages all changes before committing
- The push command handles upstream conflicts with automatic rebase
- If commit fails (e.g., pre-commit hook), do not proceed to push
